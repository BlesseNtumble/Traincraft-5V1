# Traincraft Mod License
## Usage
  * The "*.cfg" files in the Traincraft config folder are not considered part of Traincraft and may be freely distributed.

  * The Traincraft API is not considered part of Traincraft and may be freely distributed and/or used as you see fit, according to the MIT License. -ERROR the traincraft API is the very core of the mod.

  * You may not use Traincraft to generate revenue for yourself except in the cases listed below. -ERROR redundant

  * You may not distribute modified versions of Traincraft. -ERROR negates the entire point of open source

  * You may install Traincraft on multiplayer servers and are **ALLOWED** to earn revenue as you desire from server usage fees, donations, sold services, or anything else you can come up with. -ERROR most of this, and the sub points are not allowed by Minecraft's license.
    * If you wish to create a **public** client bundle including Traincraft for your users, you must follow the Public Mod Pack Restrictions below.
    * **Private client bundles are permitted without requiring that you meet the restrictions on Public Mod Packs, but they must be protected via password or white-list in such a way that only server users are allowed to access it.**


## Derivatives
  * You may create, publish, and earn revenue from a texture pack made for Traincraft so long as it contains no Traincraft code or original Traincraft art assets. -ERROR goes against Minecraft EULA

  * You may create, publish, and earn revenue from an addon made for Traincraft using the Traincraft API (addon being defined as a mini-mod that requires Traincraft be installed to function), though Mrbrutal(or a contributor) reserves the right to implement similar features if desired. However, no addon code will ever be included in Traincraft without the addon makers permission. -ERROR goes against Minecraft EULA, legal loopholes that could get us in trouble due to wording.

  * You may create, publish, and earn revenue from videos that display all or part of Traincraft. You should but are not required to provide a link to the [Traincraft Website](http://traincraft-mod.com/).

  * You may create, publish, and earn revenue from maps that require Traincraft. You may distribute Traincraft with your map if you meet the Public Mod Pack requirements defined below. If you require your users to install Traincraft, provide a link to the [Traincraft Website](http://traincraft-mod.com/). -ERROR goes against Minecraft EULA
  
## Distribution
  * Except in the case of Public Mod Packs, you may not publicly distribute Traincraft on another site without Mrbrutal's explicit permission. And if you have permission you must include a link to the [Traincraft Blog](http://traincraft-mod.com/) and [Blog](http://blog.meansoft.si/) and use the download links provided there unless you receive permission to do otherwise. Proper attribution must be provided regardless and you must post a link to this [License](https://github.com/Mrbrutal/Traincraft-164/blob/master/LICENSE.md). -Negates the entire point of Open Source.

## Public Mod Packs
  * This section pertains **ONLY** to publicly available mod packs. The section does not apply to Private Server Packs as defined previously in the Usage Section. -ERROR redundant

  * This is to be opened up after the Patreon goal is met. You can view the progres here: [Patreon](http://www.patreon.com/Mrbrutal) -ERROR its already open, so this is redundant.

    * You are **REQUIRED** to **PUBLICLY** post a licensing page with entries for all the mods currently in your mod pack (links to licenses, images of PMs, posts by devs, etc...). This is the single most important requirement you must meet. If you cannot or will not do this, you cannot use Traincraft in your mod pack. -ERROR an unreasonable amount of information to require.
    * You may not sell the mod pack. -ERROR redundant.
    * You are not allowed to use the latest series of Traincraft for at least a week after it's release, to protect against game-breaking problems or bugs. -ERROR releases/builds shouldn't be so often they are this buggy in the first place, this is also redundant because of the beta builds rule.
    * You must provide a link to the [Traincraft Blog](http://blog.meansoft.si/), [Traincraft Website](http://traincraft-mod.com) and [Traincraft License](https://github.com/Mrbrutal/Traincraft-164/blob/master/LICENSE.md) on your website. -ERROR redundant.
    * Beta builds are never to be packaged as part of a public mod pack. Only public versions of the mod can be used in Public mod packs. -ERROR redundant since other parts imply most all builds will be beta.

## Source
  
  * You **MAY** you remix, transform, or build upon the **sources** material, but you **MUST** distribute your contributions under the same license as the original. Forks and edits of the Github Project **SHOULD** be for the purpose of contributing to the Official Traincraft Project. -ERROR saying 'should' negates everything said in the point.
  
  * You **MUST** give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use. -ERROR redundant.
  
  * Contributors should work along to distribute **only one** Official Traincraft build created from a fork. -ERROR saying 'should' negates everything said in the point. -ERROR using 'should' negates everything in this point.
  
  * Official website is available for distribution of the Official Traincraft builds: contact spitfire4466@gmail.com -ERROR this is just horribly worded.
  
  * Unofficial builds may **NOT** be named or distributed under the name "Traincraft" but **MUST** contain a statement explicitely showing it is a derivative of the Official Traincraft mod. -ERROR redundant.
  
  * You may **NOT** use the material for commercial purposes. -ERROR redundant.
